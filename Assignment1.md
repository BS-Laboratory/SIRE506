Questions
---------

1.  What type of study design was used in this study?

2.  What is the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study population? Choose
    two diseases mentioned in the paper and provide the detail of inclusion &
    exclusion criteria.

3.  Was the age distribution of each disease group comparable to the age
    distribution of the control groups?

    1.  What statistical test can you use to compare the age distribution
        between the two groups?

    2.  Which disease groups had significantly different age of distribution
        than controls? Also provide the statistical evidence for the comparison.

    3.  Pick 1 disease with different age distribution between patients and
        control group. Discuss how the different in age distribution might
        affect the results of genetic association.

4.  Besides age, were there any other confounding factor(s) in the design of
    this study?

5.  What is the approach that we might be able to control those confounding
    factors?

6.  For the strongest association signal for coronary artery disease,

    1.  what is the location of this SNP?

    2.  Is there a gene nearby?

    3.  Was the SNP known or has any biological mechanism to affect the gene
        function?

    4.  Is it biologically plausible that we found this SNP associated with CAD?
