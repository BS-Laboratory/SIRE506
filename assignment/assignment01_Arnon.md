# Assignment 1

1.  What type of study design was used in this study?
```
Case control comparison from 1st page in the 5th line of the abstract.
```

2. What is the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study population? Choose two diseases mentioned in the paper and provide the detail of inclusion & exclusion criteria.
```
The inclusion criteria is the population from Great Britain. There are 6 exclusion criterias in Supplementary Table 4.
```

3. Was the age distribution of each disease group comparable to the age distribution of the control groups?
	1.  What statistical test can you use to compare the age distribution between the two groups?
	```
	Since, there is no provided statistical measurement for comparing the significance between control and disease group. So, it depends on the distribution (between normal and other kind of distributions).
	```

	2.  Which disease groups had significantly different age of distribution than controls? Also provide the statistical evidence for the comparison.
	```
	This question can not be answered because there is no provided statistically experiment value that show the evidence of the significant between each disease groups and control groups.
	```

	3.  Pick 1 disease with different age distribution between patients and control group. Discuss how the different in age distribution might affect the results of genetic association.
	```
	Type 1 diabetes is significantly different from control group since the distribution of this group tend to have only early people (age below 40) while the control has more distributed patient between age group.
	```

4.   Besides age, were there any other confounding factor(s) in the design of this study?
```
According to the Supplemental Table 1, Demographic might be a confound because of some region might have a genetic isolation, causes form the geographical and culture.
```

5.   What is the approach that we might be able to control those confounding factors?
```
This problem can be solved by stratified select the sample from each demographic.
```

6.   For the strongest association signal for coronary artery disease,
		1. what is the location of this SNP?
		```
		According to Table 3, there is SNP that has the strong association signal to CAD is chromosomes 9p21.
		```

		2. Is there a gene nearby?
		```
		According to page 667 on the CAD heading, MTAP is nearby the interested region.
		```

		3. Was the SNP known or has any biological mechanism to affect the gene function?
		```
		It has a role in polyamine metabolism that salvage both adenine and methionine.
		```

		4. Is it biologically plausible that we found this SNP associated with CAD?
		```
		Yes, the MTAP gene is the cofactors that cause polyamine metabolism to adenine and methionine. These 2 mentioned protein are the cause of having CAD.
