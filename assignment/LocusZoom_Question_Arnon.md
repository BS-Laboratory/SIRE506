1. Find the location of rs4988235
	- **Genomic coordinate** : Chromosome 2 at 135851076
	- **Gene Location :** It's on MCM6 gene (Chromosome 2 from 135,839,626 to 135,876,477)
	- **Known function alteration of this variance :** This variance has the pattern to be C/T. The SNP database also shows the connection between SNP and effect of having this SNP. When T is present, lactose digestion enzyme might not effect. So, people that has this SNP cannot digest lactose.


2. **Has this variant been reported associated with any disease phenotype(s)?**
	 Has a phenotype in lactose intolerance in European Caucasian population.
	
3. **Use Locus-Zoom data, to explore the effect of this variant on metabolic traits GWAS data available on Locus-Zoom**
	- **HDL, LDL, total cholesterol, triglyceride**
	 According to the result from Locus-Zoom found that rs4988235 is associate to total cholesterol and LDL with p-value 3.97*10^-14 and 3.22*10^-11 respectively. So, total cholesterol has more statistical power since p-value is less than p-value of LDL.
