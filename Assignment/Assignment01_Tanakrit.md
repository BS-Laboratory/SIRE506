## Questions

1.What type of study design was used in this study?

```
Case-control comparisons study
```

2.What is the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study population? Choose two diseases mentioned in the paper and provide the detail of inclusion & exclusion criteria.

```
Control groups use two control groups which have noting that DNA sample processing differed between these groups. And used ‘hyper controls’ (selection of control individuals from the lower extremity of the relevant trait distribution) to focusing on one disease which weigh against the additional costs associated with the need to phenotype and genotype each control sample. This study provided individuals with non-European ancestry are excluded, the extent of population stratification in the British population is generally modest

coronary artery disease (CAD) cases which are myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization (coronary artery bypass surgery or percutaneous coronary angioplasty) before their 66th birthday.

type 1 diabetes (T1D) cases recruit from pediatric and adult diabetes clinics at 150 National Health Service hospitals across mainland UK. The total case data set around 8,000 from the WTCCC cases. all cases to have an age of diagnosis below 17 years old and insulin dependence since diagnosis with a minimum period of at least 6 months. The cases which are suffering from rare monogenic disorders including, maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY), and latterly permanent neonatal diabetes (PNDM) are exclude.

3.Was the age distribution of each disease group comparable to the age distribution of the control groups?
3.1. What statistical test can you use to compare the age distribution between the two groups?

```
```

3.2. Which disease groups had significantly different age of distribution than controls? Also provide the statistical evidence for the comparison.

```
```

3.3. Pick 1 disease with different age distribution between patients and control group. Discuss how the different in age distribution might affect the results of genetic association.

```
```

4.Besides age, were there any other confounding factor(s) in the design of this study?

```
```

5.What is the approach that we might be able to control those confounding factors?

```
```

6.For the strongest association signal for coronary artery disease,

6.1. What is the location of this SNP?

```
SNP in *MTHFD1L*
```
   
6.2. Is there a gene nearby?
   
```
chromosome 9p21.3 genes for two cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors, CDKN2A (encoding p16INK4a) and CDKN2B
```

6.3. Was the SNP known or has any biological mechanism to affect the gene function?

```
encodes methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (NADP+-dependent) 1-like, the mitochondrial isozyme of C1-tetrahydrofolate (THF) synthase
```

6.4. Is it biologically plausible that we found this SNP associated with CAD?

```
The possibility of a link between variants in *MTHFD1L* and CAD risk that MTHFD1L activity contributes to plasma homocysteine and defects in the MTHFD1L pathway may increase plasma homocysteine level
