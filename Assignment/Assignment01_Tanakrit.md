## Questions

1.What type of study design was used in this study?

```
Case-control comparisons study
```

2.What is the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study population? Choose two diseases mentioned in the paper and provide the detail of inclusion & exclusion criteria.

```
two control groups was to assess possible bias in ascertaining control samples
Bipolar disorder (BD; manic depressive illness)
Type 2 diabetes (T2D)
```

3.Was the age distribution of each disease group comparable to the age distribution of the control groups?

   3.1.What statistical test can you use to compare the age distribution between the two groups?

    ```
    ```

   3.2.Which disease groups had significantly different age of distribution than controls? Also provide the statistical evidence for the comparison.

    ```
    ```

   3.3.Pick 1 disease with different age distribution between patients and control group. Discuss how the different in age distribution might affect the results of genetic association.

    ```
    ```

 4.Besides age, were there any other confounding factor(s) in the design of this study?

```
```

5.What is the approach that we might be able to control those confounding factors?

```
```

6.For the strongest association signal for coronary artery disease,

   6.1.What is the location of this SNP?

    ```
    ```
   
   6.2.Is there a gene nearby?
   
    ```
    ```

   6.3.Was the SNP known or has any biological mechanism to affect the gene function?

    ```
    ```

   6.4.Is it biologically plausible that we found this SNP associated with CAD?

    ```
